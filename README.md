# BigSpace

Space colonization game focused on scale. I work on this project in my spare time.

# Quick Start Guide
Clone the game into Visual Studio and Run it.

Click New Game.

Click Universe.

Use the Add Galaxy buttons to add as many galaxies as you like.

Click Finish.

Click Generate Universe (requires at least one galaxy to have been added).
  Note that generating excessively large universes may cause your system to crash.

Wait some time (may take a while for large galaxies).

Click Begin Game.
